        SOUL (Stories Online, Unified Library) is a demonstration platform
        designed to showcase how a modern web application can deliver
        ebooks and podcasts in a single unified experience. Built with
        Laravel on the backend and Next.js on the frontend, SOUL
        demonstrates best practices for building scalable, maintainable
        applications. This site is currently running on demo data. Once
        the backend APIs are fully implemented, all content and user
        actions will be persisted to the database.
